I GET THAT THIS IS AN UNUSUAL COMMUNICATION METHOD...

But its about GitHub... and open source... and our client is a seriously passionate employer of both.   So this is the best forum... 

Do you know Mulesoft?  We're retained to fill the VP, Eng role (based in SF, but also opening a Mountain View office).  The company is another Splunk or ServiceNow...  super disruptive, kick-ass engineering teams, and rocket ship revenue growth.  (revenue has scaled from $10M to ~$200M in last four years).

No idea of your timing (or interest) to look elsewhere... but I'd love to network with you at a minimum.

Whatever is easier...
